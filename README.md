# SMTP-Alert
A simple Python script for searching and synchronising an S3 bucket with a local folder. If there are new files in the relevant S3 bucket then they will be copied to a local folder of ones choosing. If there are not an SMTP email alert will be sent out to a designated address, notifying the user that synchronisation has not occured.
